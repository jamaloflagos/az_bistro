                    If you're using the latest version  of Java Development Kit, 
                    you'll need  to change the Gradle version  of your project 
                    so it can recognize the JDK.  You can do that by going to  
                    properties and changing the  distributionUrl value to upgrade 
                    the Gradle version.  You can check out here the  latest releases of Gradle.

                     follow the next few steps.
